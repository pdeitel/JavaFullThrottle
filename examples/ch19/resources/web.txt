The World Wide Web (simply called "the web") is a collection of hardware and software associated with the Internet that allows computer users to locate and view documents (with various combinations of text, graphics, animations, audios and videos) on almost any subject. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee of CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) began developing HyperText Markup Language (HTML)â€”the technology for sharing information via "hyperlinked" text documents. He also wrote communication protocols such as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to form the backbone of his new hypertext information system, which he referred to as the World Wide Web. In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, https://www.w3.org), which was devoted to developing web technologies. A key W3C goal is to make the web universally accessible to everyone regardless of disabilities, language or culture.
